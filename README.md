This is a Python implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm using the Map Reduce paradigm.
It is customized for processing a thunders dataset, extracted from [STARNET (Sferics Timing And Ranging NETwork)](http://www.zeus.iag.usp.br)  

Under **data/** folder is a sample of the thunders that "falled" on February 28, 2014.  
Under **results/** folder are CSV datasets containing all thunders of that date in a single file and the resulting clusters (for k=10 and k=50).
